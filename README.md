This repository contain basic examples to fine-tune LLMs. These scripts serve as template that could be extended to larger program. 

Here is the list of templates and their usage:

* `dev-llm-finetune-sentimental-classification.ipynb` fine-tuning a LLM for sentimental classification on idbm dataset

* `dev-llm-finetune-sentimental-classification-LORA.ipynb` fine-tuning a LLM for sentimental classification on idbm dataset, with LORA adapter

* `dev-llm-finetune-sentimental-classification-Linear-basefrozen-promptengineer.ipynb`, fine-tuning a LLM for sentimental classification on idbm dataset where base model is frozen and a prompt is added for few-shot training

* `dev-llm-finetune-sentimental-classification-Linear-basefrozen.ipynb`, fine-tuning a LLM for sentimental classification on idbm dataset where base model is frozen and only a linear decision layer is trained.
